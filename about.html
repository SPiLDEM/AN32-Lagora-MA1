    <h1>About Version Control</h1>
    <p>Version control is a system that records changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It is an essential tool for developers and teams, enabling collaboration and tracking of changes efficiently.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Use Version Control?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Multiple people can work on a project simultaneously without conflicts.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup:</strong> You have a history of your work, allowing you to revert to previous versions if necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Tracking Changes:</strong> You can see who made changes, what changes were made, and when.</li>
        <li><strong>Branching:</strong> You can create separate branches to experiment or develop features without affecting the main project.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Concepts in Version Control</h2>
    <p>Some important concepts in version control include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Repository:</strong> A storage location for your project files and the entire history of changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Commit:</strong> A snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.</li>
        <li><strong>Branch:</strong> A parallel version of your repository where you can make changes independently.</li>
        <li><strong>Merge:</strong> The process of combining changes from different branches.</li>
    </ul>
